# calculator

This is a prototype parser & evaluator for handling basic mathematics based on a string.

For example:
* "1 + 2" should parse into a tree which when executed returns 3

The purpose of this is where I have some requirements for creating rules for testing metrics collected from the rail open data feeds. These rules need to be read at run time so they need evaluating at run time.

I was going to do something simple but decided that I needed something generic - hence this project.

Right now it doesn't work other than compile, but it's being worked on.
